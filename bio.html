            <h1>Who I Am:</h1>
            <p>"I am a full-time tech apprentice at Barclays based in Glasgow. I am learning mainly Java & Python for my back-end role."</p>
            <img src="media/javaCode.png" alt="An image of some Java code I've written.">
            <p>"I am a part-time kitchen crew member at BrewDog. I make mouth-watering burgers and wings."</p>
            <img src="media/buffaloBurger.png" alt="An image of a buffalo chicken burger dipped in hot sauce, it's actually not that hot!">
            <p>"I am also an activist for migrant students' right to higher education in Scotland. I am the founder of a national campaign called: 'Our Grades, Not Visas'. (Currently working on a website for it using Zyro, keep an eye out for that!)"</p>
            <img src="media/meAtUoE1.jpeg" alt="An image of me speaking at a conference in Edinburgh on Jan 19th. A handsome guy wearing a navy suit.">
            <p>"I do badminton/rock-climbing every once in a while, but, given the fact that I have no pictures of myself doing either, you can probably tell what I mean by 'every once in a while'... "</p>
