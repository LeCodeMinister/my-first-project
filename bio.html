(Currently working on a website for it using Zyro, keep an eye out for that!). I was featured on the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-62664664">BBC</a> & <a href="https://inews.co.uk/news/migrant-students-living-in-uk-forced-to-reject-university-offers-wait-over-a-decade-to-avoid-huge-fees-1805510">inews</a>, I had a quick chat with <a href="https://news.stv.tv/">STV News</a> earlier this month, an article is getting published this week (hopefully!)."</p>

            <p>"I rock-climb/play badminton every once in a while, but, given the fact that I have no pictures of myself while rock-climbing/playing badminton, you can probably tell how often I do either..."</p>
