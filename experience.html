            <h1>My Experience:</h1>
            <h2>Work Experience:</h2>
            <p>"I worked at X (a restaurant I won't mention) as a Kitchen Porter. My first ever job, I used to get paid ¬£4.62 an hour. Getting hit by adulthood wasn't fun..."</p>
            <img src="media/xRestaurant.jpg" alt="An image of a plate served at that place (I don't even know what it's called).">
            <p>"I then moved to Ox and Finch as a Kitchen Assistant in September, 2021. I also worked briefly as a waiter/pastry chef there. I really enjoyed my time working there."</p>
            <img src="media/oxAndFinch.jpg" alt="An image of Ox and Finch from the outside, brings a lot of good memories!">
            <p>"I currently work at BrewDog as a chef, they've got a great atmosphere and the staff I work with are awesome!"</p>
            <img src="media/brewdog.jpg" alt="An image of the BrewDog branch I work at, it's huge!">
            <p>"I am a tech apprentice at Barclays, although I haven't been to the office yet. It's getting me out of my comfort zone, which is always good (eventually)."</p>

            <h2>Academic Experience:</h2>
            <p>"I have graduated from Hillhead High School last year, with a total of AAAAAAB at Higher & AA at Advanced Higher (if you don't know what those grades mean, then you should take my word they're kinda a big deal)"</p>

            <p>"I'm currently a Multiverse Software Development Apprentice. It's a great opportunity I wanna make the most out of!"</p>
